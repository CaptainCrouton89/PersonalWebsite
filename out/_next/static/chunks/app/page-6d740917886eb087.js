However, LLMs return text, not data, and are trained to behave like chat bots, not game engines. Initially, I behave like chat bots, not game engines. Initially, I solved this by using a sequence of prompts where each step wraps user content in specific instructions on processing and output-format, spits out some xml, and then gets repeated until the steps are completed.

The smaller model wouldn't need instructions on what to do, nor would it need instructions on output formatting. With it need instructions on output formatting. With a few iterations, I built our training data and fine tuned a smaller LLM model.
