### Lead Developer & Co-Founder | Mystica (Tricky Djinn LLC)
**Aug 2024 - Dec 2024 | Minneapolis, MN**

**Core Skills:** React Native (90%), PostgreSQL (75%), Redis (70%), Spring (90%)

Co-founded startup building a geo-RPG **powered by AI**, acting as **CTO and lead developer** on five-person team. Building AI-powered, text-based adventure game where players explore real-world locations and fight fantasy creatures. Learn more at [mystica.cloud](https://mystica.cloud).

**Technical Challenge:** Designed system asking AI to act as game engine rather than chatbot. Initial solution used sequence of prompts with specific instructions and XML output formatting. Improved by using larger model to create training data for smaller fine-tuned model, **reducing input token count by 50% and saving 30% on projected operating costs**.

**Key Achievements:**
- Designed and implemented system **integrating text-based LLM models with game engine**, enabling never-before-seen videogame mechanics and storytelling
- Set up multiplayer using websocket connections and Redis "sessions," **balancing lightning-fast communication** between players with **scalable backend and database**
- Set up **multiple environments** for development, testing, and live deployment with **effortless deployment** for each

**Detailed Technical Implementation:**
The core challenge was making LLMs behave like game engines rather than chatbots. The system processes user actions through a complex prompt sequence that wraps content in specific processing instructions, outputs XML metadata, and repeats until completion. This generates both narrative responses and game state metadata affecting user health and encounter status. The architecture was later optimized using a larger model to generate training data for a smaller fine-tuned model, dramatically reducing costs while maintaining performance.
